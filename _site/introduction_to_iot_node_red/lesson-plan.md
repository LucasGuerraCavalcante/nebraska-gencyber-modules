### Learning Objectives

1. Student will be able to use Node-Red to develop a simple IoT application on a Raspberry Pi.
2. Student will be able to integrate the If This Then That (IFTTT) service as an IoT cloud service.
3. Student will recall how the Cybersecurity First Principles of abstraction, least privilege, minimization, modularization, resource encapsulation, and simplicity apply to IoT applications.

### Materials list

* Raspberry Pi
* Internet connection

### Learning Facilitation

#### Warm up Activity
Students will start by discussing the concept of IoT and simple examples.

#### Focused Activity
