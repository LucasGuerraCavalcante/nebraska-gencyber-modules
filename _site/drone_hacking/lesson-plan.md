### Learning Objectives

1. Student will be able to apply safe drone operating principles.
2. Student will be able to utilize swift commands to command drones to complete an obstacle course.
3. Student will be able to determine how application of cybersecurity first principles can increase the cybersecurity of drone operation.

### Materials list

* Apple iPad with Swift Playgrounds and Parrot templates
* Safety glasses
* Optional: extra batteries and charger

### Learning Facilitation

#### Warm up Activity
Students will start by getting introduced to safety rules for flying drones.

#### Focused Activity
Students will use **Parrot Template environment** to write several commands for their drones.

#### Closure
Students will connect and maneuver their drones using the commands.

#### Reflection
Students will review relevant first principles learned through the lesson. A small kahoots (or similar) quiz will be given

### Assessment
