Avoid Phishing URL analysis	https://mlhale.github.io/nebraska-gencyber-modules/phishing/  Some research has estimated that 60 billion phishing emails are sent out every year. This lesson explores techniques for spotting phish.
Building a Server	https://mlhale.github.io/nebraska-gencyber-modules/building_a_server/	This module shows how to create a Django-Docker server that allows Littlebits to connect to in order to log and store their commands.
Ciphers and Cybersecurity in other fields	https://mlhale.github.io/nebraska-gencyber-modules/ciphers_and_cybersecurity_in_other_fields/	This module looks at how cybersecurity can be used in classes like history or english - through concepts like ciphers.
Collaboration on Github	https://mlhale.github.io/nebraska-gencyber-modules/collaboration_on_github/	This modules follows up on the introduction to git and Github lesson and shows off how it can be used for managing collaborative projects - especially those related to software development
Computational thinking and design process using Littlebits Droids	https://mlhale.github.io/nebraska-gencyber-modules/computational_thinking_and_design_process_using_littlebits_droids/	This module follows up on the intro to components by focusing on applying design process with Littlebits to solve a real world problem.
Containers	https://mlhale.github.io/nebraska-gencyber-modules/containers/	Containers are a great way to isolate services, crashes, and to limit environment resources. This lesson will show you how to create, use, and connect containers.
Drone Hacking	https://mlhale.github.io/nebraska-gencyber-modules/drone_hacking/	Drones are a fantastic technology that has many uses. This module will teach how to program a drone to fly, hover, and more.
Ethics and Digital Citizenship	https://mlhale.github.io/nebraska-gencyber-modules/ethics_and_digital_citizenship/	Ethics are acting appropriately online are the two most important character traits of cybersecurity professionals. This lesson explores ethical behavior and licensing issues for appropriately using resources.
HTTP, GET, and POST	https://mlhale.github.io/nebraska-gencyber-modules/http_get_post/	This is a placeholder description that will need to be changed, but I don't think is a rush as of the time of creating this description.
If, This, Then, That	https://mlhale.github.io/nebraska-gencyber-modules/if_this_then_that/	This is a placeholder description that will need to be changed, but I don't think is a rush as of the time of creating this description.
Internet of Strings	https://mlhale.github.io/nebraska-gencyber-modules/internet_of_strings/	This is a placeholder description that will need to be changed, but I don't think is a rush as of the time of creating this description.
Intro to Components using Littlebits Droids	https://mlhale.github.io/nebraska-gencyber-modules/intro_to_components_using_littlebits_droids/	This is a module about modules. It introduces component-based thinking using modular components in the Littlebits Droid Kit (TM).
Intro to components with Littlebits Internet of Things	https://mlhale.github.io/nebraska-gencyber-modules/intro_to_components_with_littlebits_iot/	This is a placeholder description that will need to be changed, but I don't think is a rush as of the time of creating this description.
Introduction to Cybersecurity First Principles	https://mlhale.github.io/nebraska-gencyber-modules/intro_to_first_principles/	This lesson introduces the cybersecurity first principles, provides contextual examples of each, and includes activities based on the GenCyber card game.
Introduction to Firewalls	https://mlhale.github.io/nebraska-gencyber-modules/intro_to_firewalls/	Firewalls are a technology that block or allow network traffic according to a group of rules. This lesson introduces and explores firewalls interactively.
Introduction to Git and Github	https://mlhale.github.io/nebraska-gencyber-modules/intro_to_git_and_github/	This module introduces git and Github as technologies for managing, using, and tracking changes to resources, such as source code.
Introduction to Raspberry PI 	https://mlhale.github.io/nebraska-gencyber-modules/raspberry_pi_intro/	Raspberry PI is a fun, interactive technology, that provides a linux-variant OS and full featured applications for various programmatic tasks. This lesson steps students through setting up a PI and using it.
Introduction to the Internet of Things (IoT), Node Red, and the Raspberry Pi 	https://mlhale.github.io/nebraska-gencyber-modules/introduction_to_iot_node_red/	This module follows the Raspberry PI introduction to expose students to the Node RED platform. This lesson examines node red in the context of creating simple IoT devices.
Online Safety and Privacy	https://mlhale.github.io/nebraska-gencyber-modules/online_safety_and_privacy/	Maintaining privacy and staying safe online means being cognizant of the kinds of information we put online and protecting our digital assets. The lesson explores these topics in a human-centric way. It also examines OSINT (or open source intelligence) to show how easy it is to find information online.
Penetration Testing	https://mlhale.github.io/nebraska-gencyber-modules/penetration_testing/	Web servers are constantly bombarded with attacks. This lesson explores how developers can get ahead of attackers and test their web apps to identify vulnerabilities.
Understanding REST and APIs	https://mlhale.github.io/nebraska-gencyber-modules/understanding_rest_and_apis/	You use APIs every day, probably without know it. APIs, or application programming interfaces, allow different web servers to exchange information with one another. This lesson explores how this works using littlebits as an enabling technology.
Web services and IoT using Littlebits and IFTTT	https://mlhale.github.io/nebraska-gencyber-modules/web_services_and_iot_using_littlebits_and_ifttt/	This is a placeholder description that will need to be changed, but I don't think is a rush as of the time of creating this description.
Web services and IoT using Littlebits Droids and IFTTT	https://mlhale.github.io/nebraska-gencyber-modules/web_services_and_iot_using_littlebits_droids_and_ifttt/	This module explores how web service resources can be "mashed up" with IoT devices. Littlebits and a service called IFTTT are used as enabling technologies within the lesson.
