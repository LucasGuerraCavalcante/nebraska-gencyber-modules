title: Introduction to Components With Littlebits
---
### Cybersecurity First Principles in this lesson
**Modularity:** The concept of modularity is like building blocks. Each block (or module) can be put in or taken out from a bigger project. Each module has its own separate function that is interchangeable with other modules.
**Abstraction:** A fancy word for summarizing or explaining in a way that we can easily understand.
**Resource Encapsulation:** Encapsulating (hiding) resources so you can only see the main function of the resource.

### Introduction
#### What are littlebits?
* Each littleBit is an electronic circuit or switch, and it has its own unique function.
* Each littleBit snaps together using magnets and are connected in a sequence, to make a circuit.
* Developed by Ayah Bdeir while working on her Master’s degree in Computing Culture at MIT. She created the first littleBits prototypes on her own in 2011.

### Goals
1. Understand modularity.
2. Know how littleBits work.

### Basics of littleBits
* The bits are grouped into four different categories:
⋅⋅* Power (Blue)- Power Bits, plus a power supply, run power through your circut.
⋅⋅* Wire (Orange)- Wire Bits connect to other systems and let you build circuts in new directions.
⋅⋅* Input (Pink)- Input Bits accept input from you or the environment and send signals that affect the Bits that follow.
⋅⋅* Output (Green)- Output Bits do something; Light up, buzz, move...
* Bits snap together with magnets. The arrows on the magnets always go RIGHT.
* Order is important. Power bits always come first and input bits only affect the output bits that come after them.

#### Challenges
* **Challenge 1:** You suspect that your sibling has been breaking into your room and snooping around in your stuff, but you never seem to catch them in the act. You decide to create a littleBit Invention that will alert you the next time your sibling is in your room.
* **Challenge 2:** Get alerted if your refrigerator door has been left open for too long! The FDA says that your fridge should be set between 38 and 40 degrees Fahrenheit. If the temperature rises above this temperature for an extended period of time, your food could go bad. Prevent this from happening by creating a invention littleBits smart fridge circuit so you can save your food!
