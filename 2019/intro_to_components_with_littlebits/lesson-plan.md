### First Principles
**Modularity:** The concept of modularity is like building blocks. Each block (or module) can be put in or taken out from a bigger project. Each module has its own separate function that is interchangeable with other modules.
**Abstraction:** A fancy word for summarizing or explaining in a way that we can easily understand.
**Resource Encapsulation:** Encapsulating (hiding) resources so you can only see the main function of the resource.
