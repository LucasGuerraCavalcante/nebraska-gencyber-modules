### Features of a Phishing Attempt
* Asks you to verify or update your account information, such as name, date of birth, mothers maiden name, security questions, credit card information, and password.
* The tone gives a sense of urgency or that you're in trouble. You have a limited time to respond.
* There are spelling and grammar errors.
* Sounds too good to be true.
* The greeting is generic, such as “Hello” with no name or “Dear Valued Customer.”
* The closing is generic, such as “Sincerely, Customer Support” with no name or contact information.
* Links or attachments that lead you to a login page or a online form where you will have to provide personal information.
* Asks you to call a phone number to get more information.
* Asks for money to be electronically transferred.

### How to Avoid a Phishing Attack
* Remember the features of a Phishing Attempt.
* Be cautious about sharing your home address, email address or phone number online or in person.
* Don’t answer unknown phone calls. Select “block caller” on phone numbers you don’t recognize.
* Mark emails as “spam” so your email provider will filter in the future.
* If you’re concerned about the validity of a potential phishing email, text or phone call…
⋅⋅* Do some research. Verify the name of the company, check to see if there is a Scam Alert on the BBB website.
⋅⋅* Call the customer service phone number. Verify its the same contact information given in the email, text, or phone call.
* Trust your conscience.  If something doesn’t look or sound right, you’re probably right.

### Analysis in Phishing Attempts
**URL** stands for Uniform Resource Locator. Most email or text message phishing attacks start with a specially-crafted URL. Even if an email or text doesn’t have any of the phishing features, you can still get hooked!

#### Reading a URL
* If you read the URL from left to right, like English, then this URL appears legitimate.
* https://www.facebook.fblogin.com/home
* Reading a URL left to right is the  wrong way to read a URL.
* **You should read a URL from right to left.**
* FIRST, start on the right of the URL and locate the Top Level Domain (.com)
* The Domain name after the Top Level Domain is the registered user of the website.
* It is registered by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).
* https://www.accounts.facebook.com/**verifylogin**/user/
* https://www.facebook.**fblogin.com**/home
