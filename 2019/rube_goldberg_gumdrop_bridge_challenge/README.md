### Cybersecurity First Principles in this lesson
* __Abstraction__: An abstraction is a representation of an object or concept. It could be something such as a door, a speedometer, or a data structure in computer science. Abstraction decouples the design from the implementation. The gauges in an automobile are an abstraction of the performance of a car. A map is an abstraction of the earth.

* __Layering__: Cyber security uses multiple layers of defense or protecting information. If one layer is defeated the next layer should catch it.

* __Modularization__: The concept of modularity is like building blocks. Each block (or module) can be put in or taken out from a bigger project. Each module has its own separate function that is interchangeable with other modules.

* __Resource Encapsulation__: Encapsulation is an object oriented concept where all data and functions required to use the resource are packaged into a single self-contained component. The goal is to only allow access or manipulation of the resource in the way the designer intended. An example, assume a flag pole is the object. There are fixed methods on how the flag pole is to be used. Put the flag on, take the flag off, raise or lower the flag. Nothing else can be done to the flag pole.

### Introduction
This lesson continues the Rube Goldberg design by introducing a gap-spanning bridge. The bridge must be initiated by the maze login zone. It should kick-off a second Ozobot that will drive across the bridge and continue into the freestyle zone. 

### Goals
* reinforce computational thinking 
* reinforce design thinking and prototyping/testing methodology through hands-on exercises 
* build conceptual metaphors from physical sciences to computer sciences

### Materials Required
* Dot candies 
* toothpicks or popsicle sticks 
* weights (washers or quarters work)
* student workbook page
* Road deck design template

### Building a bridge 
Just like in the prior Rube Goldberg Maze Challenge, the Gumdrop bridge has some hard-and-fast requirements that any solution-seeking design must address. 

### Requirements 
* Enables Ozobot Transport across the bridge 
* Must support provided drivable Road deck 
* Must not collapse under at least 100g of weight load 
* Must span approximately one foot gap 

### Design Goals (and prizes)
A good bridge is both supportive (holds a lot of weight) and is made with low cost. We will have prizes that award both types of bridges (and hybrids that balance both design goals). Specifically the bridge with the best features will be awarded a prize at the end of camp:

* Most weight supported 
* Least Number of resources used in the design 
* Resource-to-weight ratio 

A `resource` in this context is any supply item (e.g. a toothpick, a dot candy, a pobsickle stick, etc). Weight supported will be measured in grams. Resource-to-weight ratio will be measured as the fraction of materials used to the weight supported by the bridge. Weight will be added to a cup or plate on top of your bridge to measure its weight-supportive capability.
